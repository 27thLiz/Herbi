## How to create levels

1. Install Tiled www.mapeditor.org (In linux it is called "tiled")
2. Install www.python.org 2.7 (Already installed by most linux distros)
3. Copy level/blank_level.tmx as level_0.tmx
4. Open level_0.tmx with Tiled
5. Save it
6. Run convert_all.py (Edit line 15 to point it to your tiled executable/binary)
7. Enable debug mode in global.gd
8. Press T to open Level 0

Once its set up, making levels will become easier than ever.
